                As you approach the front gate of the haunted house, the ominous silhouette of the decrepit mansion looms before you, casting long, eerie shadows in the dim moonlight. You hesitate, considering whether to turn back or continue forward. The wind carries a spine-chilling whisper, urging you to enter. Will you dare to explore the house of horrors?
            </p>
            <p>With resolve, you push the creaking front door open and step into the pitch-black hallway. The air is thick with the scent of decay, and the silence is deafening. Three doors stand before you, each one laden with an aura of foreboding.</p>
            <p>Options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><button id="door1-button">Door 1: The Dining Room</button></li>
                <li><button id="door2-button">Door 2: The Basement</button></li>
            </ul>

                You open the door to the dark, foreboding basement. As you descend the creaky stairs, you hear shuffling and moaning in the shadows. It's too late to turn back now; you've ventured too far. Suddenly, a group of ravenous zombies emerges from the darkness and devours you, your screams echoing in the basement's depths.
            </p>
            <p>Your choices have led to a gruesome end.</p>
            <p>The End.</p>

                You open the door to the Dining Room, which is adorned with dusty, antique furniture and an imposing chandelier. The room is eerily quiet, but you notice a faint glimmer of light coming from the kitchen at the far end. You decide to explore the Dining Room further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inside, you find a long, ornate dining table, set with tarnished silverware and covered in cobwebs. The room has an eerie, forgotten beauty to it, and as you approach the table, you notice a tattered note.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a sense of trepidation, you pick up the note and read the shaky handwriting:
            </p>
            <p>
                "Beware the cursed silverware."
            </p>
            <p>
                Curiosity piqued, you continue to investigate the room. Suddenly, the silverware on the table starts to rattle and rise into the air, swirling around you. The forks and knives become sharp, gleaming weapons, and they advance menacingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must make a quick decision to survive:
            </p>
            <p>Choose wisely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><button id="run-button">1. If you decide to make a run for the door</button></li>
                <li><button id="defend-button">2. If you search for an object to defend yourself</button></li>
                <li><button id="reason-button">3. If you try to reason with the possessed silverware</button></li>
            </ul>
