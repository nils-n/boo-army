How to Fork and Clone the Repository:

- We have created a wiki page in the repository that provides detailed instructions on how to fork and clone the project. You can view the wiki page by clicking [here](link to the wiki page).


## Testing

- Testing was a continuous process throughout the entire construction phase. We harnessed the power of Chrome Developer Tools as we built, using them to identify and resolve any issues that cropped up.

- Throughout development, we relied on Google Developer Tools to validate the functionality of our project and to aid in diagnosing problems when things didn't behave as anticipated.

- We made extensive use of the developer tools' console to systematically examine and verify the performance of specific JavaScript sections, as well as to diagnose and rectify any issues that arose along the way.


### V3C Validator

We employed W3C for HTML validation across all pages of the website, and it was equally instrumental in validating our CSS.
