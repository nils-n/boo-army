## User Experience

### User Stories

As a user I would like: 


* Use click on the story to start.

* Understand how to use the website immediately so that I can enjoy a quick and seamless user experience.

* See options to progress the story at each room so I can move through the haunted house.

* Easily access a "Start Over" button to restart the game.

* See visually appealing illustrations/animation and sounds so that the adventure feels more engaging.

* Interact with elements on the website such as buttons for multiple choices and can navigate to the next room or perform an action to ensure my survival in the game.

### Design

### Colour Palette

The colour palette is dark and spooky for an eerie atmosphere. The main colours are black, white, red. As well as, two shades of orange which are inspired by the colour of pumpkin.

### Typography

The fonts employed for this website include Nosifer from Google Fonts and a sans-serif typeface. Nosifer was specifically chosen for the main title due to its unique and edgy design. This font boasts angular, jagged characteristics that give it a modern and striking appearance. With its somewhat ominous vibe, it's particularly suitable for Halloween-themed text.

### Imagery

The images featured in this project were generated using the Leonardo.ai app.

Additionally, the rooms were created using three.js.


### Wireframes

During the planning stage, we utilized Balsamiq for crafting our wireframes.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

This web application was developed using the following technologies:

* HTML: Used for structuring the content of the web pages.
* CSS: Used to style the web pages with a Halloween-themed color palette and design.
* JavaScript: Implemented for interactivity, allowing users to make choices that affect the story's progression.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
The project also utilizes the following frameworks, libraries, and programs:

* Git: for version control
* Github: to save code
* Balsamiq: to create the wireframes for the website.
* Favicon.io: to generate the tab icon.
* Google Fonts: used to import fonts into the webpage.
* Am I Responsive: to check if the website is responsive for various devices and screen sizes.
* Coolors: to create the colour palette
* Three.js: to create and build the rooms.
* Vite React: for the build of optimized assets for production
* FigJam: to create brainstorm ideas in real-time.
* Pixabay: for the royalty-free music and sound effects


## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

To deploy the site using GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

* Log in to GitHub (or sign up if you don't have an account).
* Navigate to the repository associated with this project.
* Click on the "Settings" button.
* In the left-hand navigation menu, select "Pages."
* From the source dropdown, choose the main branch and click "Save."
* The site will be deployed, but please keep in mind that it might take a few minutes for the site to go live.

### Local Development

How to Fork and Clone the Repository:

* We have created a wiki page in the repository that provides detailed instructions on how to fork and clone the project. You can view the wiki page by clicking [here](https://github.com/nils-n/boo-army/wiki).


## Testing

* Testing was a continuous process throughout the entire construction phase. We harnessed the power of Chrome Developer Tools as we built, using them to identify and resolve any issues that cropped up.

* Throughout development, we relied on Google Developer Tools to validate the functionality of our project and to aid in diagnosing problems when things didn't behave as anticipated.

* We made extensive use of the developer tools' console to systematically examine and verify the performance of specific JavaScript sections, as well as to diagnose and rectify any issues that arose along the way.


### V3C Validator

We employed W3C for HTML validation across all pages of the website, and it was equally instrumental in validating our CSS.

* ![HTML](https://github.com/nils-n/boo-army/blob/zai.3-branch/documentation/w3c-validator.png)

* ![style.css](https://github.com/nils-n/boo-army/blob/zai.3-branch/documentation/jigsaw-css-main.png)


### Jslint Validator 

* JSLint showed no erroes, but few warnings about things that are not necessarily wrong in the application. 

* Due to time constraints, there wasn't an opportunity to address and rectify these code warnings. However, this is a task we plan to tackle in the future.
